<p>A website[1] or web site[2] is a collection of related network web resources,
  such as web pages, multimedia content, which are typically identified with a common
  domain name, and published on at least one web server. Notable examples are wikipedia.
  org, google.com, and amazon.com.

Websites can be accessed via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the
Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by a uniform resource locator (URL)
 that identifies the site.

Websites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can
be a personal website, a corporate website for a company, a government website, an
organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or
 purpose, ranging from entertainment and social networking to providing news and
 education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web,
  while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically
  part of an intranet.
